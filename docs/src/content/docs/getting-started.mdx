description: Learn how to install and configure the Starlight Markdown blocks plugin
---

This plugin extends [Starlightâ€™s Markdown asides syntax](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/#asides), so that it can be used to render custom block types.

For example, just like you can use `:::tip` to render an aside in Starlight, you can use this plugin to add support for syntax such as `:::my-custom-block` and control how that renders.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers';

<Steps>

1. `starlight-markdown-blocks` is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/). Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-markdown-blocks" />

2. Add the plugin to your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```js ins={4,11-15}
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
   import starlightMarkdownBlocks from 'starlight-markdown-blocks';

   export default defineConfig({
   	integrations: [
   		starlight({
   			title: 'My Docs',
   			plugins: [
   				starlightMarkdownBlocks({
   					blocks: {
   						// Blocks configuration
   					},
   				}),
   			],
   		}),
   	],
   });
   ```

3. You can now add support for custom blocks by adding entries to the `blocks` configuration object.

</Steps>

## Configuring blocks

Configure blocks by adding entries to the `blocks` object passed to the `starlightMarkdownBlocks()` plugin.
Each key in `blocks` will become a name you can use in your Markdown files.
For example, if you add an `idea` key, you will be able to use `:::idea` in your Markdown files to render that block type.

The value of each block configuration defines how it should render.
There are built-in block renderers for common use cases and you can also write your own.

### Configuration example

The following configuration example adds an `:::idea` block using the built-in `Aside` helper that renders like Starlightâ€™s asides but with a custom label, color, and icon.
It also adds a custom `:::figure` block to support authoring HTML `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements without having to write HTML directly.

```js {4,12-18}
// astro.config.mjs
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import starlightMarkdownBlocks, { Aside } from 'starlight-markdown-blocks';

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [
		starlight({
			title: 'My Docs',
			plugins: [
				starlightMarkdownBlocks({
					blocks: {
						idea: Aside({ label: 'Idea', color: 'green', icon: 'ðŸ’¡' }),
						figure: {
							render: ({ h, label, children }) =>
								h('figure', {}, [...children, h('figcaption', {}, label)]),
						},
					},
				}),
			],
		}),
	],
});
```

With this configuration, Markdown documents can use these new custom block types:

```md title="example.md"
:::idea
I just thought of something!
:::

:::figure[â€” Donna Haraway, <cite>A Cyborg Manifesto</cite>]

> One is too few, and two is only one possibility.

:::
```

::::preview

:::idea
I just thought of something!
:::

:::figure[â€” Donna Haraway, <cite>A Cyborg Manifesto</cite>]

> One is too few, and two is only one possibility.

:::
